 Ulam and Sacks Spiral Visualization

This Python script creates a visual representation of Ulam and Sacks spirals using Pygame library. The Ulam spiral is a graphical depiction of prime numbers named after mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, while the Sacks spiral is a similar construct with different starting positions.

 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- Numpy library

 Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `spiral_visualization.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the script using the command `python spiral_visualization.py`.
4. Use the arrow keys to control the size and position of the spiral.
5. Press the escape key or close the window to exit the program.
 Features

Ulam Spiral: Generates a spiral where prime numbers are highlighted in red, green, and blue.
Sacks Spiral: Generates a spiral similar to Ulam's, but with different prime number highlight positions.
Interactive Controls: Allows users to navigate and resize the spiral using arrow keys.
Notes

The script uses the Pygame library for visualization.
Prime numbers are highlighted with different colors for easy identification.
 The size and position of the spiral can be adjusted interactively.
